Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

## Business tasks:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I have started the data analysis journey with the six phases of data analysis:
1) Ask Phase
2) Preapre Phase
3) Process Phase
4) Analyze Phase
5) Share Phase
6) Act Phase

The details of the analysis are included in the presentation along with key findings and recommendations.
